# loop-templates

These are the template files shared and used by our loop generation tools, such as

- Our `@oliveai/create-loop` [npx command](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oliveai/create-loop)
- Our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Olive-AI.vscode-loop-development-kit)

While anybody can technically install this library, it's really only useful to the tools above. If
you're looking to create a loop from a template, we recommend using one of them!
